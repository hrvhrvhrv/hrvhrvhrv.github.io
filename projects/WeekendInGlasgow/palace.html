            <h4>The History of Glasgow</h4> </div>
        <h3 class="subHeading">History</h3>
        <p> The People’s Palace was established in 1898 and was designed by the engineer Alexander B. McDonald. It was designed to be a cultural centre for the people living in the East End of Glasgow. The building has closed only once for restoration work and the re-opening was timed to happen on it’s 100th anniversary of when it first opened in 1898, there is a plaque on display just after the main entrance detailing this. Changes that were made include the Winter Gardens behind the main building being constructed and the gardens being tidied. Further work was done in 2005 on the fountain which changed it’s position to sit in front of the museum. </p>
        <h3 class="subHeading">Collection</h3>
        <p> The museum when it was first opened provided visitors with reading a recreation rooms on the ground floor, the museum itself on the first floor and a picture gallery on the second (top) floor. The museum shows the everyday life of the community of Glasgow from 1750 to the present day and how it has changed throughout those years. For example one of the displays is a single tenement home in Glasgow and another is “The Steamie”, a place where laundry used to be done in many peoples everyday lives who were living in Glasgow. </p>
        <h3 class="subHeading">Contributor</h3>
        <h4>Ken Currie</h4>
        <p> One of the main contributors to the museum was an artist by the name of “Ken Currie”. His paintings usually depicted different aspects of negative human mortality, such as ageing and illness. A popular painting by him is “Chimera”, a picture depicting a handful of people in a dark room, with some of them looking rather pale and or strange. </p>
