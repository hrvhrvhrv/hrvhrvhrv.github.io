            <h4>Scotlands Oldest Museum</h4> </div>
        <h3 class="subHeading">History</h3>
        <p> The Hunterian Museum was founded in 1807, it is one of Scotland’s oldest public museums and was once a university. Later after opening the University moved to a new site in Gilmorehill as the city centre was too crowded. The money in order to build the museum came from a Scottish scientist by the name of “William Hunter”. Hunter was an avid collector of all kinds of European art, from coins, minerals and paintings to even collecting insects. The Hunterian has closed once for additions but it re-opened in September 2011 with a new gallery dedicated to Romans in Scotland </p>
        <h3 class="subHeading">Collection</h3>
        <p> The collections of the museum are contained within multiple different buildings around it’s campus. Those buildings are: The Hunterian Museum, Zoology Museum, Hunterian Art Gallery and The Mackintosh House. The first building, the Hunterian Museum, contains items such as scientific instruments, items on the Roman Empire, and some also from ancient Egypt. The second building, The Zoology Museum, contains an extensive insect collection including some items from William Hunter. The third building, The Hunterian Art Gallery, houses an extensive collection on general and watercolour art. It also has a garden contain many different sculptures. The final building, The Mackintosh House, is a recreation of the house which the architect “Charles Rennie Mackintosh” lived in. It features very extensive woodwork like that seen in Mackintosh’s real home. </p>
