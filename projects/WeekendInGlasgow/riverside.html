            <h1>Riverside Museum</h1>
            <h4>History of Scottish Travel</h4> </div>
        <h3 class="subHeading">History</h3>
        <p> The Riverside Museum was opened on the 21st of June 2011 and the construction of it began in late November 2007. Large trenches had to be dug during it’s development in order to host the building’s services. It was designed by Zaha Hadid Architects and Buro Happold. The museum costed a whopping £74 million in order to be fully built, some of this money was donated by major companies such as Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems Surface Ships. </p>
        <h3 class="subHeading">Collection</h3>
        <p> The museum is well known for housing a variety of different kinds of transport and vehicles such as cars, busses and a steam locomotive. It currently houses over 3000 objects. When compared to the Glasgow Transport museum which only had 1,300 objects Riverside has truly surpassed expectations. The museum also has Cranes and ships on display which was only recently acquired. A lot of what is on display is interactive as well. </p>
        <h3 class="subHeading">Contributor</h3>
        <h4 class="highlight">L. S. Lowry</h4>
        <p> L. S. Lowry, or Laurence Stephen Lowry, was an English artist who mostly drew paintings of his home Pendlebury where he lived and worked for about 40 years. A highlight of his artistry would be a painting called “Going To Work” which depicts a large crowd of people in World War 2 who are presumably going to their jobs, with bombs in the sky and fencing around a building area. </p>
