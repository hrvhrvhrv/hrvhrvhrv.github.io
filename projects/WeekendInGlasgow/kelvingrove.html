            <h1>Kelvingrove</h1>
            <h4>Art Museum</h4> </div>
        <h3 class="subHeading">History</h3>
        <p> The museum was established in 1901 and has been around for many years. In the year 2003 the museum was closed for major refurbishment until 2006. The museum currently has 22 different themed art galleries on display with over 8000 objects to see, one of the most grand objects on display is the large pipe organ located in the central hall, which acts as a symbol for the museum itself.</p>
        <p> The gallery was designed by Sir John W. Simpson and E.J Milner Allen. There is a popular myth about the buildings construction, some say it was accidently built back to front, and when the architect discovered this he jamp from one of the towers in despair. Though this is an urban myth and most assuredly untrue.</p>
        <h3 class="subHeading">Collection</h3>
        <p> The collections contained in the museum have come mainly from the McLellan Galleries and the Kelvingrove House Museum which was formerly in Kelvingrove Park. Examples of collections contained in the gallery are a vast natural history collection and one of the world’s greatest collections of weapon arms and armour. The museum also has a vast range of European artwork on display from well known artistic figures such as Van Gogh and Claude Monet. Information on more collections can be obtained by visiting the museum itself during it’s opening times as it is completely free to enter. </p>
        <h3 class="subHeading">Contributors</h3>
        <h4 class="highlight">Rembrandt van Rijn</h4>
        <p> Rembrandt van Rijn was a Dutch draughtsman, painter and printmaker who donated to the museum. He drew a variety of different paintings from portraits to landscapes. One example of his art is “The Prodigal Son in the Tavern” which is a self portrait of himself and a woman named “Sastria” </p>
        <h4 class="highlight">Gerard de Lairesse</h4>
        <p> Gerard de Lairesse was another important artist who donated to the museum. Along with artistry, he also had talent in music, theatre and poetry. An example of a well known painting by this artist would be the “Allegory of Five Senses”, a painting depicting two women and multiple children next to a vase of flowers. </p>
