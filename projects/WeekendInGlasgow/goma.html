        <h2 class="subHeading">History</h2>
        <p> The Gallery of Modern Art (GOMA) officially opened as an art gallery in 1996 but the building was constructed in 1778. It sits in the centre of Glasgow next to George Square. The building has seen multiple different uses throughout the years. Originally, it was a townhouse for a one “William Cunninghame” who was a tobacco lord. It was then bought in 1817 by the Royal Bank of Scotland before they later moved to Buchanan Street. After that it became the Royal Exchange, extra additions were made to the building in order to serve this purpose such as the large hall at the back and Corinthian pillars. The last purpose it served before turning into an art gallery was a library in 1954. </p>
        <h3 class="subHeading">Collection</h3>
        <p> Exhibits contained in the gallery display works from David Hockney, Sebastio Salgado and Andy Warhol along with two Scottish artists John Bellany and Ken Currie. The gallery contains a wide range of different facilities and services outside of the actual art itself. Some of what the building supplies consist of free Wifi, a café and book lending and more. The gallery has free admission besides a few exhibits so cost for entry is fairly minimal. </p>
        <h3 class="subHeading">Contributor</h3>
        <h4 class="highlight">Andy Warhol</h4>
        <p> Andy Warhol is an American artist, director and movie producer who’s works are currently contained in the gallery. An example of one of his works is a pop art painting done by him of Marilyn Monroe. </p>
